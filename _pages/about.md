I'm a math BA/MA student at [Hunter College](https://hunter.cuny.edu/){:target=\blank"}, where my masters thesis is being advised by [Vincent Martinez](http://math.hunter.cuny.edu/vmartine/){:target=\blank"}. I'll be starting a math PhD at [Stony Brook](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/) in Fall 2021.
